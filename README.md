<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This prototype visualizes an example of a fully implemented interface within a multi-function food processor.It is based on the user-flow shown in the following figure. 
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/CookingAssistant/user_flow3_TcIC5VLlfnZ.png" alt="User flow" width="500" />
</p>


Although our prototype does not cover all functions that a real multi-function food processor can offer, it provides a generic solution to research examples for multimodal interaction throughvoice & touch interaction. 

The prototype is adaptable to different insights and recommendations, allowing for further research. The software architecture is seen in the following figure.

This prototype is meant to run locally or on a server like AWS. To run it locally please refer to the section <a href="#development">Development</a>.

### Built With

Inititally the frontend application is built with svelte and has a node server which serves as a middleware to the Rhasspy instance.

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
- [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You need to have node and npm installed. To run it on your machine we propose to have docker and docker-compose installed. 

<br />

### Development

### 1. Start the Application:

Install the dependencies...

```bash
#from root
cd frontend
npm install

#from root
cd server
npm install
```

<br />

**Start with docker** (_Recommended_):

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

<br />

**Start without docker** (Not recommended):

```bash
#from root
cd frontend
npm run dev

#from root
cd server
npm run start-dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

### 2. Connect Application with local Rhasspy Environment

To run a local Rhasspy Envrionemnt you need to have docker and docker-compose installed.

```bash
cd rhasspy
docker-compose up
```

Navigate to [localhost:12101/](http://localhost:12101). You see the environment running&nbsp;

The first time you have to adjust the Rhasspy settings in the UI environment:

1. Click the Home Button
2. Go to Advanced
3. Copy the file rhasspy/profile.json from this repo in it and click "Save Profile".
4. Click on the "Sentences-Menu-Icon" in the left Menu Bar
5. Copy the file rhasspy/template.ini from this repo in it and click "Save Sentences"
    > Dataset in the file rhasspy/template.ini is provided under a [“CC BY 4.0”](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
6. Click "Okay" in the Retrain Rhasspy Alert

Now you can test the prototype. For further adaption of the Rhasspy environment please refer to the official doumentation of <a href="https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Rhasspy</a>.
   <br />
   <br />

## Production

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

This version expects an .env file in root directory with follwing content:

```bash
    #.env
    PORT=3000
    HOST=0.0.0.0
    MQTTHOST=<YOUR_RHASSPY_HOST_IP>
    RHASSPY_PORT=12183
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You see your app running.

## Dataset for Spoken Language Understanding

You can apply our large amounts of in-domain dataset for your spoken language understanding research.
- Training Dataset (1964 queries with 10724 running words): rhasspy/NLU/trainset.md
- Test Dataset (839 queries with 4507 running words): rhasspy/NLU/testset.md

## Recommendations

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

This prototype was tested in the Browser <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/"> Google Chrome </a>.
