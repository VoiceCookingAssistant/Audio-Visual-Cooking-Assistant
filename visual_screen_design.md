# Visual Screen Design
## Browse List of Recipes
On the recipe list, the user is able to view available recipes. Using the touch screen and/or voice, they may page through the library, filter by dietary requirements, or search for a recipe ingredient. The icon in the top middle of the screen is a visual indicator for when the device is receiving audio input. The other icons, from left to right, control the brightness of the device, change the volume, and bring up additional user settings.

</p>

## Recipe Checklist
After selecting a recipe from the list, the user sees the Recipe overview. They can read (or have read to them) information such as the ingredients, how long the recipe takes to complete, and steps in the recipe. They can also modify the recipe for dietary restrictions, if possible, or adjust portions in the recipe. Again, these interactions can be done through both voice and touch.

## Navigate through different steps
Sample screens for different recipe steps. The arrow icons in the bottom left and right (or voice command like “next step”) navigate the user to different steps. Tapping “Done” or “Mix”, or saying a command like “I’m finished” indicates that the current step has been completed. A progress bar at the tops indicates both where the user is in the recipe, and what steps have been completed. 

Add some sugar          |  ... and eggs

## Error Handling
A user may indicate they are done with a step, even if has not been completed exactly as in the recipe, such as adding different ingredient amounts. For example, if a user wants less sugar in their dish, they may finish the weighing step with their desired amount. The device will confirm they want to deviate from the recipe, then complete the step.

</p>

## Manipulation of Process Settings
Steps that use more complex features of the device, such as mixing, heating, or sautéing, can be manipulated by the user. They user can adjust the time and speed of the function through the interface or by voicing a command, for example: “Beat the egg whites on medium speed for three minutes”.

Once they start the process, the time remaining is shown through the progress bar.

## Quit The Screen
The user may quit the recipe at any time, and be returned to the home menu.
